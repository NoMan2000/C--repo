#My Boilerplate for C\# sharp

This is a C# boilerplate so I can look at it when I need a quick refresher.  If you want to use it, that's fine by me, no accreditation necessary except, you know, ***I INVENTED IT*** and that's all.  :)

Like many new files I've put up here, it's intended mostly for personal use when I need a template or a quick reminder on how something works in a programming language.
